# 7-days-coding-challenge-solutions
This repository contains my solutions for a 7-day coding challenge, where I tackle 15 medium-level coding problems within a week. Each solution is written to be clear, efficient, and to help others understand my approach to problem-solving. Follow along to see how I break down each problem, strategize, and improve my skills one day at a time.
